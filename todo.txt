***** To Do List *****

- Figure out a way to make sure plugins have all of the functions they need, 
    in order to be a valid plugin. This means there should be compile errors
    when attempting to compile the plugin if the plugin does not have the 
    functions required.

- Set up a way for the plugin to create additional functions within the 
    plugin, that the main program will call when it decides to do so. 
    This may need the ability for the plugin to call main program functions.

- Figure out how to let the plugin call a function of the main program.
    Only certain functions, however, are allowed to be called. Perhaps we
    should not allow functions of the main program to be called at all?
    Either way figure something out.

- Figure out a way to have the main program load plugins from a specific 
    directory, instead of needing the plugin paths to be hard coded. 

- Strive to make error messages as helpful as possible, both when compiling
    the plugins(I don't know how much control I have over that), and most
    importantly, when a plugin fails to load correctly. 



***** Completed Items *****

- Figure out how to dynamically load a .so for use as a plugin.

- Create a few initial plugins to test out different use cases. 
    (Somewhat of an on going process)
